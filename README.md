### Wina Bwangu Financial Dashboard

This is my school project for a financial dashboard that helps track mobile money transactions. I built it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show how a money transfer company in Zambia might track their business.

## What it does

- Tracks transactions for services like Airtel Money, MTN Money, and others
- Shows revenue calculations based on transaction amounts
- Stores user accounts and transaction history using localStorage
- Has a responsive design that works on phones too


## Features I built

- User login and registration
- Transaction form for entering new transactions
- Dashboard with some basic stats
- Transaction history page
- Services information page


## How to use it

1. Download the files
2. Open index.html in your browser
3. Register a new account
4. Try adding transactions and check the dashboard


This was my first big JavaScript project and I learned a lot about working with forms, localStorage, and responsive design. I'm still working on adding more features like charts and better filtering options.

Note: "Wina Bwangu" means "Quick Money" in a local Zambian language.
